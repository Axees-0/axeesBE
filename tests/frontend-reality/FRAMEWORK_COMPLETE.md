## üöÄ Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Authentication Bug Hunt (üîê)
- **Purpose**: Detect authentication security vulnerabilities
- **Tests**: Token expiry, multi-device conflicts, password security, session management
- **Critical Coverage**: User data protection during auth flows

### Phase 2: Form Data Bug Hunt (üìù)
- **Purpose**: Prevent form data loss and validation issues
- **Tests**: Page refresh data preservation, validation error handling, submit button states
- **Critical Coverage**: Protects users from losing 20+ minutes of form work

### Phase 3: Real-time Communication Bug Hunt (‚ö°)
- **Purpose**: Ensure reliable real-time features
- **Tests**: WebSocket recovery, message ordering, typing indicators, file uploads
- **Critical Coverage**: Chat functionality and real-time synchronization

### Phase 4: Performance Bug Hunt (üöÄ)
- **Purpose**: Detect performance bottlenecks
- **Tests**: Page load times, memory leaks, large list rendering, Core Web Vitals
- **Critical Coverage**: User experience optimization under real-world conditions

### Phase 5: Mobile Interface Bug Hunt (üì±)
- **Purpose**: Mobile-specific user experience issues
- **Tests**: Touch targets, virtual keyboard, viewport handling, accessibility
- **Critical Coverage**: Mobile usability and accessibility compliance
