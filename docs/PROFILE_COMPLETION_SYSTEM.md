## Database Schema

### User Model Enhancements
```javascript
{
  profileCompletion: {
    score: { type: Number, default: 0, min: 0, max: 100 },
    completedSteps: [String],
    requiredFields: {
      basic: {
        completed: Boolean,
        fields: {
          name: Boolean,
          email: Boolean,
          phone: Boolean,
          bio: Boolean,
          avatar: Boolean
        }
      },
      roleSpecific: {
        completed: Boolean,
        fields: Mixed // Dynamic based on user type
      },
      verification: {
        completed: Boolean,
        fields: {
          emailVerified: Boolean,
          phoneVerified: Boolean
        }
      },
      financial: {
        completed: Boolean,
        fields: {
          stripeConnected: Boolean,
          paymentMethodAdded: Boolean
        }
      },
      preferences: {
        completed: Boolean,
        fields: {
          settingsConfigured: Boolean,
          categoriesSelected: Boolean
        }
      }
    },
    lastCalculated: Date,
    notifications: {
      enabled: { type: Boolean, default: true },
      lastSent: Date,
      frequency: { type: String, enum: ["daily", "weekly", "never"] }
    }
  }
}
```

## Automatic Calculation System

### Pre-save Middleware
The system automatically recalculates profile completion whenever relevant fields change:

```javascript
userSchema.pre("save", function (next) {
  const profileRelevantFields = [
    'name', 'email', 'phone', 'bio', 'avatarUrl', 
    'emailVerified', 'stripeConnectId', 'paymentMethods', 
    'settings', 'creatorData', 'marketerData'
  ];
  
  const hasProfileChanges = profileRelevantFields.some(field => 
    this.isModified(field)
  );
  
  if (hasProfileChanges || !this.profileCompletion) {
    this.calculateProfileCompletion();
  }
  
  next();
});
```

### Calculation Logic
1. **Basic Fields (30 points)**: Name, email, phone, bio, avatar
2. **Role-specific Fields (25 points)**:
   - **Creators**: Handle, categories, platforms, portfolio, rates
   - **Marketers**: Brand name, website, industry, description, budget
3. **Verification (20 points)**: Email and phone verification
4. **Financial (15 points)**: Stripe connection and payment methods
5. **Preferences (10 points)**: Settings and category selection

## Automated Reminder System

### Cron Jobs Schedule
- **Profile Reminders**: Every Wednesday at 10 AM
- **Onboarding Reminders**: Daily at 9 AM

### Reminder Logic
```javascript
// Profile completion reminders
const reminderTypes = {
  gentle: "score < 75",
  encouraging: "score < 50 && daysSinceRegistration > 7", 
  urgent: "score < 25 && daysSinceRegistration > 3",
  final: "score < 95 && score >= 75"
};

// Onboarding reminders
const onboardingSchedule = {
  day3: "Welcome reminder",
  day7: "Don't miss out reminder"
};
```

### Smart Targeting
- **Frequency Respect**: Honor user's notification preferences
- **Completion Awareness**: Don't remind users with 95%+ completion
- **Recent Activity**: Skip users who received reminders within the last week
- **Device Availability**: Only send to users with active device tokens

## Business Benefits
