# Enhanced Negotiation Table Implementation

## Overview
The negotiation table has been significantly improved to provide comprehensive negotiation management, analytics, and user experience enhancements.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Negotiation Controller (`controllers/negotiationController.js`)

#### New Endpoints:

- **GET /api/negotiation/:offerId** - Get comprehensive negotiation table data
- **POST /api/negotiation/:offerId/counter** - Submit enhanced counter offer
- **POST /api/negotiation/:offerId/accept** - Accept current negotiation terms
- **POST /api/negotiation/:offerId/reject** - Reject negotiation
- **POST /api/negotiation/:offerId/message** - Add message/note to negotiation
- **GET /api/negotiation/analytics/user** - Get user negotiation analytics

### 2. Enhanced Data Models

#### Updated Counter Schema:
```javascript
{
  counterBy: String,
  counterAmount: Number,
  notes: String,
  counterDate: Date,
  deliverables: [String],
  priority: String, // low, medium, high, urgent
  expiresAt: Date,
  isMessage: Boolean,
  isAcceptance: Boolean,
  isRejection: Boolean,
  acceptedTerms: Object,
  attachments: Array
}
```

#### New Negotiation Metrics:
```javascript
{
  totalRounds: Number,
  negotiationStarted: Date,
  lastActivity: Date,
  convergenceScore: Number,
  averageResponseTime: Number,
  participantEngagement: {
    marketerResponses: Number,
    creatorResponses: Number
  }
}
```

### 3. Key Improvements

#### Analytics & Insights:
- **Negotiation Metrics**: Automatic calculation of rounds, duration, response times
- **Convergence Analysis**: Smart scoring to predict negotiation success
- **Participant Engagement**: Track response patterns and engagement levels
- **Success Rate Tracking**: Historical performance analytics

#### Enhanced User Experience:
- **Comprehensive Table View**: Full negotiation history with context
- **Smart Recommendations**: AI-driven suggestions based on negotiation patterns
- **Priority Management**: Counter offers can have priority levels
- **Expiration Handling**: Time-limited counter offers
- **Message Threading**: Internal notes and messages within negotiations

#### Better Data Structure:
- **Typed Interactions**: Distinguish between counters, messages, acceptances, rejections
- **Rich Attachments**: Enhanced file handling for negotiations
- **External References**: Link to calendar events, deals, contracts

    },
    "metrics": {
      "totalRounds": 2,
      "convergenceScore": 78
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Get User Analytics
```javascript
GET /api/negotiation/analytics/user?userId=64f7b8e8c123456789abcdef

Response:
{
  "success": true,

    }
  }
}
```

## Database Schema Changes

### Automatic Metrics Calculation
The offer model now includes a pre-save middleware that automatically calculates negotiation metrics:

```javascript
offerSchema.pre("save", function (next) {
  if (this.isModified('counters')) {
    // Update total rounds
    this.negotiationMetrics.totalRounds = this.counters.length;
    
    // Calculate response times
    // Update engagement counts
    // Set negotiation timestamps
  }
  next();
});
```

## Benefits
