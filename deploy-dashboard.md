# Deploy Dashboard to Netlify

## Current Status
The new dashboard implementation has been pushed to the `dashboard` branch on GitHub.

## Deployment Issue
The Netlify CLI is attempting to rebuild the project automatically when deploying, which is causing timeouts. The site appears to have a build command configured that triggers on every deployment.

## Manual Deployment Options

### Option 1: Update Site Settings (Recommended)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites/polite-ganache-3a4e1b/settings/deploys
2. Under "Build settings", clear the build command or set it to `echo "Skip build"`
3. Set publish directory to `dist`
4. Save changes
5. Then run: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist`

### Option 2: Deploy via Dashboard
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites/polite-ganache-3a4e1b/deploys
2. Drag and drop the `dashboard-deployment.zip` file
3. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 3: Deploy from GitHub
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites/polite-ganache-3a4e1b/settings/deploys
2. Under "Deploy contexts", add a branch deploy for `dashboard`
3. It will automatically deploy when detecting the branch

### Option 4: Create New Build Locally
```bash
# Build locally first
npm run export:web

# Once complete, deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```
