# Deployment System Refactoring Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2024-12-30

### üéâ Major Changes

#### Unified Deployment System
- **Created** `scripts/deployment/unified-deploy.js` - Single deployment script replacing 16+ duplicate scripts
- **Created** `deployment.config.js` - Centralized configuration file for all deployment settings
- **Created** `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment documentation consolidating 7+ separate docs

#### Package.json Updates

- **Added** `deploy:clean` - Clean build and deploy
- **Removed** `build:web` - Duplicate of `export:web`

### üîß Technical Improvements

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**
   - Consolidated 16 deployment scripts into 1 unified script
   - Removed ~1,400 lines of duplicate code
   - Standardized on Node.js (removed mix of bash/JS scripts)

2. **Better Configuration Management**
   - All settings now in `deployment.config.js`
   - Support for multiple environments (production, staging, dev)
   - Configurable timeouts and memory limits

3. **Improved Authentication**
   - Multiple token source support
   - Better error messages for auth failures
   - Clear setup instructions

4. **Enhanced Features**
   - Zip file deployment support
   - Custom directory deployment
   - Resource checking before build
   - Progress tracking and logging

### üìù Documentation Consolidation

**Before:** 7 separate deployment docs with overlapping/conflicting information
**After:** 1 comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT.md` with:
- Quick start guide
- Authentication setup
- Advanced options
- CI/CD integration
- Troubleshooting
- Best practices

### üóëÔ∏è Deprecated Files

Created `DEPRECATED_README.md` marking these scripts for removal:
- auto-deploy.js
- auto-netlify-deploy.js
- deploy.sh / deploy-axees.sh
- deploy-both-versions.sh
- deploy-dual-correct.sh
- deploy-final-dual.js
- deploy-simple-dual.js
- deploy-simple.sh
- deploy-to-specific-site.js
- deploy-via-api.sh
- deploy-with-token.js
- direct-deploy.js
- direct-netlify-upload.js
- force-netlify-deploy.js
- simple-deploy.js

### üõ†Ô∏è Migration Tools

- **Created** `scripts/cleanup-deployment-legacy.js` - Interactive tool to:
  - Identify legacy deployment artifacts
  - Backup old files before removal
  - Clean up deprecated scripts and docs

### üìä Impact Summary

- **Lines of Code:** Reduced by ~1,400 lines
- **Number of Scripts:** From 16+ to 1
- **Documentation Files:** From 7 to 1
- **Maintenance Burden:** Significantly reduced
- **Consistency:** Single source of truth for deployments

### üöÄ Usage

```bash
# Old way (multiple scripts with different behaviors)
./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh
node scripts/deployment/auto-deploy.js
./scripts/deployment/deploy-with-token.js

# New way (unified interface)
npm run deploy              # Build and deploy
npm run deploy:quick        # Deploy only
npm run deploy:clean        # Clean build and deploy
```

### ‚ö° Next Steps

1. Run cleanup tool to remove legacy files:
   ```bash
   node scripts/cleanup-deployment-legacy.js
   ```

2. Update any CI/CD pipelines to use new commands

3. Update team documentation/wikis

4. Remove deprecated scripts in next release
