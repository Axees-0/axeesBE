# Navigation Issues Found

## Summary
During navigation testing, we discovered that the simplified AuthGuard is not properly protecting routes due to Expo Router's nested route group structure.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Route Path Mismatch
- Tab routes are accessed through the `(tabs)` route group
- Expected: `/messages`, `/notifications`, `/profile`
- Actual: Routes are nested under `(tabs)` group
- AuthGuard checks for `/messages` but route might be `/(tabs)/messages`

### 2. Authentication State Not Propagating
- AuthContext uses AsyncStorage with keys: `axees_token` and `axees_user`
- Web version of AsyncStorage maps to localStorage
- Tests show auth state not being read properly even with correct keys

### 3. Simplified AuthGuard Working Correctly
- The simplified AuthGuard logic is clean and correct
- Uses declarative `<Redirect>` components (much better than complex useEffect chains)
- The issue is with route path matching, not the guard logic itself

## Recommendations

1. **Update PROTECTED_ROUTES array** to include both variations:
   - `/messages` and `/(tabs)/messages`
   - `/notifications` and `/(tabs)/notifications`
   - `/profile` and `/(tabs)/profile`

2. **Add route debugging** to understand actual pathname values

3. **Consider using route groups** in the PROTECTED_ROUTES definition

## Next Steps
- Update AuthGuard to handle nested route groups
- Add comprehensive route logging
- Test with actual authentication flow (not mocked)
