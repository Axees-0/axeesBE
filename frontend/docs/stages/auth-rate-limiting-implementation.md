# Auth Rate Limiting Implementation

## Overview
Implemented authentication rate limiting with exponential backoff to prevent brute force attacks.

## Key Features

### 1. Rate Limiting Logic
- **5 failed attempts** allowed before lockout
- **Exponential backoff**: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s... up to 5 minutes
- **Per-identifier tracking**: Phone numbers tracked separately
- **Automatic cleanup**: Old attempts removed after 15 minutes

### 2. User Experience
- Clear error messages: "Too many login attempts. Please try again in X seconds."
- Attempts reset on successful login
- No impact on legitimate users

### 3. Implementation Details

**AuthRateLimiter Class** (`utils/AuthRateLimiter.ts`):
- Singleton pattern for consistent state
- Memory-based storage (no persistence needed)
- Automatic cleanup timer

**Login Integration** (`app/(Registeration)/UAM001Login.tsx`):
- Pre-login check prevents unnecessary API calls
- Failed attempts recorded in onError handler
- Successful login resets attempts

## Security Benefits

1. **Brute Force Protection**: Exponentially increasing delays make attacks impractical
2. **Resource Protection**: Reduces server load from repeated failed attempts
3. **User Account Security**: Protects user accounts from unauthorized access attempts

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
node test-auth-rate-limiting.js
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Memory-based**: Rate limits reset on server restart
2. **Per-instance**: Not shared across multiple server instances
3. **Phone-based**: Could be enhanced with IP-based tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **Redis Integration**: For distributed rate limiting
2. **IP-based Tracking**: Additional layer of protection
3. **CAPTCHA Integration**: After X failed attempts
4. **Account Lockout**: Temporary account suspension after extreme attempts

## Production Considerations

- Monitor failed login attempts in Sentry
- Set up alerts for suspicious patterns
- Consider adding rate limiting to other endpoints
- Review and adjust thresholds based on usage patterns
