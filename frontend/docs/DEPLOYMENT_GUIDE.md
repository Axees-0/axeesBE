## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify CLI (Fastest)
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Navigate to frontend directory
cd /home/Mike/projects/axees/axeesBE/frontend

# Build the project (this may take 5-10 minutes)
npm run export:web

# Deploy to new Netlify site
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### Option 2: Netlify Drag & Drop
1. Build the project locally:
   ```bash
   npm run export:web
   ```
2. Create a zip file of the `dist` folder
3. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
4. Drag and drop the zip file to create a new site

### Option 3: GitHub + Netlify (Recommended for Production)
1. Push this code to a new GitHub repository
2. Connect to Netlify:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - "New site from Git" → Connect GitHub
   - Build command: `npm run export:web`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

### Option 4: Manual Build Transfer
If the build fails locally, you can:
1. Download the source code package created at: `/home/Mike/projects/axees/axeesBE/axees-frontend-with-fixes.tar.gz`
2. Extract it on a local machine with Node.js
3. Run `npm install && npm run export:web`
4. Deploy the generated `dist` folder to Netlify

## 🔧 Environment Variables
For production deployment, set these in Netlify:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=your-backend-url
```

## 📁 Key Files Added/Modified
- `public/_redirects` - SPA routing configuration
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify build configuration  
- Multiple accessibility improvements across all components
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Improved mobile responsiveness

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Deploy using one of the methods above
2. Test the deployed site to verify all fixes are working
3. Update DNS/domain settings if needed
4. Monitor for any production issues

The deployed site will have significant improvements in:
- **Accessibility** (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- **User Experience** (better feedback, validation, navigation)
- **Mobile Performance** (responsive design fixes)
- **SEO** (proper routing and meta tags)
