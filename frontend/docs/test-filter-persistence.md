# Filter State Persistence Test Plan

## Issue
Category chips lose their state after an error (E-03 from QA report)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added persistent filter state storage using React refs
- Filter state (selectedTag, searchText, submittedSearch) is stored in a ref that persists across component re-renders
- State is automatically synchronized with the ref whenever it changes
- On component mount, filter state is restored from the ref

### 2. Enhanced error handling in React Query
- Added `keepPreviousData: true` to maintain UI data during errors
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added error recovery that preserves filter state

### 3. Improved error UI
- Shows error banner with retry button when error occurs but cached data exists
- Error empty state shows retry button that restores filter state
- Toast notification confirms filters are preserved during errors

### 4. Applied fixes to both components
- Updated `/components/web/index.tsx` (main explore page)
- Updated `/components/web-static-old.tsx` (legacy component)

## Test Steps

1. **Basic Filter Persistence Test**
   - Navigate to Explore page
   - Select a category chip (e.g., "Racing")
   - Trigger a network error (disconnect internet or use browser dev tools)
   - Verify selected category chip remains highlighted
   - Click retry button
   - Verify filter is still applied after recovery

2. **Search + Filter Persistence Test**
   - Enter search term "Emma"
   - Select "Fashion" category chip
   - Trigger network error
   - Verify both search text and category selection persist
   - Reconnect and verify filters still work

3. **Error Banner Test**
   - Apply filters and load results
   - Trigger network error on subsequent requests
   - Verify error banner appears at top with retry button
   - Verify cached results still display
   - Click retry in banner to recover

4. **Toast Notification Test**
   - Apply filters
   - Trigger network error
   - Verify toast appears saying "Unable to load creators. Your filters have been preserved."
   - Verify filters remain selected

## Expected Results
- Filter state (category chips and search) should never be lost during errors
- Users can retry failed requests without re-entering their filters
- Clear error feedback with easy recovery options
