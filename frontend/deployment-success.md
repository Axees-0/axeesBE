# Deployment Success Report

## Date: July 1, 2025

### Issue Resolved
The deployment pipeline was broken due to permission errors in the `dist` directory (owned by root). Every deployment was re-deploying old files because the build process couldn't update the corrupted dist directory.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Identified Alternative Build Directories**: Found that `temp_build` directory had proper permissions and contained the latest changes
2. **Created Alternative Deployment Script**: Built `deploy-from-temp.js` to deploy from alternative directories
3. **Fixed Site ID Issue**: Updated deployment to use the correct Netlify site UUID: `e4389bf8-fc47-4c5e-9426-f11b25e5bcf3`
4. **Fixed Permission Issues**: Corrected `.netlify` directory permissions

### Deployment Details
- **Production URL**: https://polite-ganache-3a4e1b.netlify.app
- **Deploy ID**: 686427f196b18d0d634542d8
- **Unique Deploy URL**: https://686427f196b18d0d634542d8--polite-ganache-3a4e1b.netlify.app
- **Source Directory**: temp_build (with latest navigation changes)

### Verified Changes
- ✅ 5 navigation tabs deployed
- ✅ Discover tab as home page
- ✅ New navigation structure active

### Future Recommendations
1. **Fix dist directory permissions permanently**:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R Mike:Mike dist
   ```

2. **Update deployment configuration** in `deployment.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   sites: {
     production: 'e4389bf8-fc47-4c5e-9426-f11b25e5bcf3', // Use UUID instead of name
   }
   ```

3. **Use the alternative deployment script** when issues arise:
   ```bash
   node scripts/deployment/deploy-from-temp.js --prod
   ```
