mike okay we're gonna go through this uh i wrote a little list in there i want to go over everything and you know i i'm not doing the best right now so i'm pushing myself uh there may be some things that don't know if you're supposed to go down or something. If this is the main menu for the dashboard. But you can see that there's the recent activity, which could be mixed with this. This is where we want to see all of the recent activity, not here and then there, right? When a user comes in, they need a sector for something, some updates here some updates there some information here no it needs to be very concise and very thought out thought through so for example another thing is this color in here is just like really i get the idea but the fact that it's just so big it it's not looking too good like you can make the button maybe a little one like that and then this of space here and then I think that analytics kind of go along the same as this so there should be a way where you for example you display all these things right here and then this one's and then there has to be a button where if you play analytics you where you are and then you just can't collapse it again. I don't know if that makes any sense. Or another alternative is you can have just the basics here and when you and this one's to the recent activity also You know instead of collapsing it down or anything like that just takes you somewhere else, and that's fine but The other thing is Understanding the language hmm See Campaigns My campaigns my network like I think it should be within my campaigns because they're sort of related very closely it should be something that has like on the same page like it's basically all your stuff right and you can sort of there's like a tab it's like there's a screen kind of like in here let me see how you have this this and the payments are so closely correlated they have to be like you have to be able to see the money generated from your campaigns in the same space because those two thoughts are very close together right so there there needs to be instead of seeing that all the details in there right you just see sort of like the financial details and that's it like obviously cool right but more strictly to if you're doing your taxes here you see that you see what networks they're on this is very important
