# Immediate Quick Fixes - Based on Transcript Feedback

## Top 3 Issues to Fix Today:

### 1. Button Size on Explore Page
**Problem**: "this color in here is just like really i get the idea but the fact that it's just so big"
**Fix**: Reduce primary button heights from 41px to 32px

### 2. Recent Activity Consolidation
**Problem**: "recent activity, which could be mixed with this... needs to be very concise"
**Fix**: Create single activity feed component instead of scattered updates

### 3. Campaign + Payments Connection
**Problem**: "payments are so closely correlated they have to be like you have to be able to see the money generated from your campaigns"
**Fix**: Add payment status badges to deal cards

## Quick Implementation Code:

### 1. Update Button Styles (GlobalStyles.ts)
```typescript
export const ButtonStyles = {
  primary: {
    height: 32, // reduced from 41
    paddingHorizontal: 16, // reduced from 20
    fontSize: 14, // reduced from 16
  }
}
```

### 2. Unified Activity Component
```typescript
// components/UnifiedActivity.tsx
export const UnifiedActivity = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Recent Updates</Text>
      <View style={styles.list}>
        {/* All activity types in one place */}
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};
```

### 3. Payment Badge for Deal Cards
```typescript
// Add to DealCard component
<View style={styles.paymentBadge}>
  <Text style={styles.paymentStatus}>
    ${deal.amount} â€¢ {deal.paymentStatus}
  </Text>
</View>
```
